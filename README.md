# Brains Media Solutions - Project

#### Note

This build does not contain "node modules" to reduce the size of package make sure to run "npm install" before using the source files.

My designs may look less appealing as i am a front end developer and do not have much experience as a UI designer.

#### Things to consider

- Buttons that need to redirect users to external paths or backend related tasks do not work as the backend is not connected for now.
- Navigation menu in mobile mode is intentionally placed at the bottom of the screen for easy one handed operation.
- Images used in the site are not the final images but placeholders that can be replaced with the desired images.
- Dummy text has been used for content as requested.
- There are no animations added to the site as I ran short on time but I might be able to get them done on the hosted link by the time of checking.

#### Additional features

- On the mobile navigation menu there is a text based page indicator which shows the name of current page
- Mobile navigation also contains a search bar that is a placeholder idea and can be implemented if needed.
- The "Blog" button on navbar is just a placeholder to show how the navbar will look with more elements.
